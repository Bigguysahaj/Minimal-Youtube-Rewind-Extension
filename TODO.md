- [ ] Optimize the main logic within the content.tsx.
- [ ] Some smooth (LERP) algorithim for smoother rewind.
- [ ] Publish on Chrome Webstores.
- [ ] Seo additions, visuals graphics etc.
- [ ] Post on Reddit. Twitter. Linkdin. 



What we might do in this stream (scope of the stream):

- [x] Show the demo of the current project.
- [x] Sign up to a developer account.
- [ ] For smooth launch fix all the key details on the project.
- [ ] Launch on chrome webstore.
- [ ] Need to explain how it works properly (what keys to press, how to use it). 
- [ ] Need a good copy (SEO) and visuals for the project. 
- [ ] Post on Reddit. Twitter. Linkdin.

- [ ] Fix firefox compatibility.
- [ ] Bind shortcuts to the (already set speeds).
= shift + long-press(space) = rewind (2x) 
= space  = pause
= long-press (space ) = 2x 
- [ ] Implement key binds to set up that speed for a while (trigger default speeds using keyboard shortcut)
- [ ] Research if it's possible to speed up an existing video.


I'm going for a small walk, will be back soon.
